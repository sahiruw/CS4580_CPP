# CS4580 Advanced Data Structures

## Lab 1: Implementing external sort using quick sort and merge sort as internal sorting methods.

### Requirements:
- Internal Memory that can be used for the program is 16 MB. You can partition the 16 MB for relevant buffers as needed.
- Size of the file with unsorted numbers is 256 MB. You can generate random numbers between 1 to one Million for this purpose and should not be sorted.
